# Microsoft Office Activator 
KMS Office Activator mimics a Key Management Service (KMS), a technology various corporations use to manage software activation across multiple devices.

## How It Works
Microsoft Office Activator typically employs one of two methods:

- KMS Emulation (Key Management Service): This method mimics a licensed volume-based activation server, tricking Office into believing it is activated through a corporate network.

- Digital License Injection: This approach directly modifies system files or registry entries to register Office as permanently activated.

## Features
1. Offline Activation: Functions without requiring an internet connection.

2. Permanent Activation: Aims to provide lasting activation without expiration.

3. Broad Compatibility: Works with various Office versions (e.g., Office 2016, 2019, 2021, Microsoft 365).

4. Automation: Often includes scripts or graphical interfaces to simplify the activation process.

## Common Tools
Examples of such utilities include:

- Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS): A lightweight, open-source tool using HWID/KMS38 activation methods.

- KMSAuto Lite: A portable tool that emulates a KMS server locally.

- AutoKMS: An automated version of KMS activation often bundled with Office installations.
